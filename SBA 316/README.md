### info on *secret journal* 
For my page, I decided to make a one page journal entry where you can see the entries "saved" on the page in reverse submission order.

######
A few things I learned: 
- the "required" keyword for an input only works as intended when all the inputs are nested in a form tag

- adding an eventListener for a "submit" action only works on the form object, not the button itself

- e.stopDefault() on a form submit prevented the page from refreshing, allowing me to populate my journal entries
